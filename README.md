This repository contains the code for a SmartCanBin, an innovative bin that uses various sensors and technologies to optimize waste management.

# Description
The SmartCanBin is designed to be a user-friendly and efficient waste disposal system. It incorporates features like:

Fill level sensor: The bin can detect its fill level and notify users when it needs emptying.
Compaction mechanism: The bin can compact waste, reducing its volume and maximizing capacity.
Smart features (optional): The bin can integrate with smart home systems or waste management services for functionalities like automated scheduling for pickup or waste sorting reminders.
